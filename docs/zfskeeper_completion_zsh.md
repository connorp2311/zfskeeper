## zfskeeper completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(zfskeeper completion zsh); compdef _zfskeeper zfskeeper

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	zfskeeper completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_zfskeeper"

#### macOS:

	zfskeeper completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_zfskeeper

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
